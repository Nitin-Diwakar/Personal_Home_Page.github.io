            I've been a professional technical writer for more than 
            25 years. I have over 90 books to my credit, which have sold more than four million copies
        worldwide. I've been building websites since 1996, so I have intimate knowledge of HTML, CSS,and
        web design. My passion is to write books and articles to pass along that knowledge and to create tools that help people build awesome web pages.
